# G8 (version for Android is coming)
为上次参加GMTC大会做的一个日程App，设计和部分效果参考了Facebook出品的F8项目:

# Usage
1. The repository contains parts for server and react native client, you can pay your attention to codes in client named 'GmtcClient' after cloning.
2. `cd GMTC`
3. `npm install` install required libraries
4. `react-native run-ios` of course, you need OSX system to run ios.
If possible, please go [here](https://applean.cn). It could be easier to program react-native on the [site](https://applean.cn).  
*If you encounter some problems while experiencing G8, just contact me for some help or create issues in this repository.*
